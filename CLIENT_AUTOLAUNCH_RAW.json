      "Install the relevant dependencies `sdl2 glew cmake python make patch git`. SM64EX will link `jsoncpp` dynamic if installed. If not, it will compile and link statically.",
      "Obtain the code base by cloning the relevant repository via `git clone --recursive https://github.com/N00byKing/sm64ex`. Copy your legally dumped rom into your sm64ex folder (if you are not sure where your folder is located, do a quick Windows search for sm64ex). The name of the ROM needs to be `baserom.REGION.z64` where `REGION` is either `us` or `jp` respectively.",

      "As an alternative to launching the game with SM64AP-Launcher, it is also possible to launch the completed build with the use of Windows batch files. This has the added benefit of streamlining the join process so that manual editing of connection info is not needed for each new game. However, you'll need to be somewhat comfortable with creating and using batch files.",

      "Navigate to the folder you selected for your SM64 build when you followed the Build guide for SM64AP-Launcher earlier. Once there, navigate further into `build` and then `us_pc`. This folder should be the same folder that `sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe` resides in.",
      "From now on, whenever you start an offline, single-player game, just download the `.apsm64ex` patch file from the Generator, then drag-and-drop that onto `offline.bat` to open the game and start playing.",
      "NOTE: When playing offline patch files, a `.save` file is created in the same directory as your patch file, which contains your save data for that seed. Don't delete it until you're done with that seed.",
      "These steps are very similar. You will be making a batch file in the same location as before. However, the text you put into this batch file is different, and you will not drag patch files onto it.",
      "When using a US Rom, the In-Game messages are missing some letters: `J Q V X Z` and `?`.",
      "When using the Launcher follow the normal build steps, but when choosing a folder name use the same as before. The launcher will recognize this, and offer to replace it."
