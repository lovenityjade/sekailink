#
# The default values of each weight are meant to give a distribution of items matching:
# - 20% Common Items
# - 12% Uncommon Items
# - 5% Rare Items
# - 3% Legendary Items
# - 20% Common Upgrades
# - 12% Uncommon Upgrades
# - 5% Rare Upgrades
# - 3% Legendary Upgrades
# - 10% Gold
# - 10% XP
#
# Combining the items and upgrades of different rarities is:
# - 40% Items
# - 40% Upgrades
# - 10% Gold
# - 10% XP
#
# This distribution is a wild guess at a good default mix of items, upgrades, gold, and XP, and may be adjusted in the
# future depending on player feedback.
#
# The ratios of common/uncommon/rare/legendary item and upgrades were chosen to roughly match the distribution of
# common/uncommon/rare/legendary values in the game itself. This is determined by looking at the max chance of each
# appearing in the shop as documented here: https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Shop#Rarity_of_Shop_Items_and_Luck.
# It's not a perfect approximation, but it "feels" correct.
