## Can I use these?

Absolutely! Feel free to use any of the jingles in this repository, especially for Archipelago game implementations.
You can use the MIDIs to make your own renditions of these themes, or use any of the premade jingles in the "Examples" folder.

It'd be nice if you gave some credit on your project's page or readme, and in the software itself if there is some sort of credits section.
If you do credit me, please credit me as "NewSoupVi", thank you!
